# **create_notification_channel**
> CreateNotificationChannel201Response create_notification_channel(create_notification_channel_request, x_omnismith_project_id=x_omnismith_project_id)

Create a notification channel

Registers a new external notification channel for the current project. Channels can be of type `telegram` (configured with a Telegram bot token), `webhook` (configured with endpoint URL, custom HTTP headers, and authentication methods such as bearer token or basic auth), or `push` (FCM mobile push notifications). Configured channels can then be linked as target actions in automation rules.

### Example

* Bearer (JWT) Authentication (bearerAuth):

```python
import omnismith_sdk
from omnismith_sdk.models.create_notification_channel201_response import CreateNotificationChannel201Response

# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = omnismith_sdk.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.omnismith.io/v1"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization (JWT): bearerAuth

A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential's `projects` claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code `stale_project_grant`; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 `no_project_selected`. Two clients holding the same credential may send different values at the same time. (optional)

    try:
        # Create a notification channel
        api_response = api_instance.create_notification_channel(create_notification_channel_request, x_omnismith_project_id=x_omnismith_project_id)

A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential's `projects` claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code `stale_project_grant`; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 `no_project_selected`. Two clients holding the same credential may send different values at the same time. (optional)

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **id** | **UUID**| Unique notification channel UUID to update | 
 **update_notification_channel_request** | [**UpdateNotificationChannelRequest**](UpdateNotificationChannelRequest.md)|  | 
 **x_omnismith_project_id** | **UUID**| The project this call acts on. A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential&#39;s &#x60;projects&#x60; claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code &#x60;stale_project_grant&#x60;; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 &#x60;no_project_selected&#x60;. Two clients holding the same credential may send different values at the same time. | [optional] 

### Return type

void (empty response body)

### Authorization

[bearerAuth](../README.md#bearerAuth)

### HTTP request headers

 - **Content-Type**: application/json
 - **Accept**: application/json

### HTTP response details

| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
**204** | Notification channel successfully updated |  -  |
**400** | Bad Request |  -  |
**401** | Unauthorized |  -  |
**404** | Notification channel not found |  -  |
**422** | Validation Error |  -  |
**409** | No project is selected. The caller is authenticated but the request is tenant-scoped, so a project must be selected before it can be answered. The response body carries &#x60;\&quot;code\&quot;: \&quot;no_project_selected\&quot;&#x60;, which clients branch on to offer a project picker rather than an access-denied message. |  -  |
