# **create_access_token**
> CreateAccessToken201Response create_access_token(create_access_token_request, x_omnismith_project_id=x_omnismith_project_id)

Create a programmatic API access token

Generates a new programmatic API access token prefixed with `omni_` (e.g. `omni_live_secret_key_...`) for the authenticated user within the active project context. The token inherits the user's current role permissions and scopes for authenticating automated API clients and scripts. The raw secret key is returned exactly once in the response and cannot be recovered later.

### Example

* Bearer (JWT) Authentication (bearerAuth):

```python
import omnismith_sdk
from omnismith_sdk.models.create_access_token201_response import CreateAccessToken201Response
from omnismith_sdk.models.create_access_token_request import CreateAccessTokenRequest
from omnismith_sdk.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.omnismith.io/v1
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = omnismith_sdk.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.omnismith.io/v1"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization (JWT): bearerAuth
configuration = omnismith_sdk.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with omnismith_sdk.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = omnismith_sdk.AccessTokensApi(api_client)
    create_access_token_request = omnismith_sdk.CreateAccessTokenRequest() # CreateAccessTokenRequest | 
    x_omnismith_project_id = UUID('018b2f1b-7c3a-7d2e-8f1a-2b3c4d5e6f7d') # UUID | The project this call acts on. A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential's `projects` claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code `stale_project_grant`; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 `no_project_selected`. Two clients holding the same credential may send different values at the same time. (optional)

    try:
        # Create a programmatic API access token
        api_response = api_instance.create_access_token(create_access_token_request, x_omnismith_project_id=x_omnismith_project_id)
        print("The response of AccessTokensApi->create_access_token:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling AccessTokensApi->create_access_token: %s\n" % e)
```

 **create_access_token_request** | [**CreateAccessTokenRequest**](CreateAccessTokenRequest.md)|  | 
 **x_omnismith_project_id** | **UUID**| The project this call acts on.

# **delete_access_token**
> delete_access_token(id, x_omnismith_project_id=x_omnismith_project_id)

Delete an API access token

Permanently revokes and removes a programmatic API access token by its unique identifier. Any future API request using the revoked secret key will immediately fail authentication with a 401 Unauthorized status.

# **list_access_tokens**
> ListAccessTokens200Response list_access_tokens(x_omnismith_project_id=x_omnismith_project_id)

List API access tokens

Retrieves all active and expired programmatic API access tokens created by the authenticated user for the active project context. Returns token metadata including unique ID, user-assigned label, creation date, expiration timestamp, and last used timestamp. Note: raw secret API keys are only displayed once upon generation and are never returned in list responses.
