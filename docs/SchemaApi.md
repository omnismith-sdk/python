# **get_project_schema**
> ProjectSchemaResponse get_project_schema(x_omnismith_project_id=x_omnismith_project_id)

Get complete project schema graph

Retrieves the consolidated schema graph for the active project in a concise, token-efficient shape. Includes all active templates (with bound attributes, business rules, and executable actions) and attributes (with semantic types, list choice options, and foreign entity reference targets). Ideal for AI agents, client initialization, metadata caching, and schema introspection.

### Example

* Bearer (JWT) Authentication (bearerAuth):

```python
import omnismith_sdk
from omnismith_sdk.models.project_schema_response import ProjectSchemaResponse
from omnismith_sdk.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.omnismith.io/v1
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = omnismith_sdk.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.omnismith.io/v1"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization (JWT): bearerAuth
configuration = omnismith_sdk.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with omnismith_sdk.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = omnismith_sdk.SchemaApi(api_client)
    x_omnismith_project_id = UUID('018b2f1b-7c3a-7d2e-8f1a-2b3c4d5e6f7d') # UUID | The project this call acts on. A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential's `projects` claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code `stale_project_grant`; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 `no_project_selected`. Two clients holding the same credential may send different values at the same time. (optional)

    try:
        # Get complete project schema graph
        api_response = api_instance.get_project_schema(x_omnismith_project_id=x_omnismith_project_id)
        print("The response of SchemaApi->get_project_schema:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling SchemaApi->get_project_schema: %s\n" % e)
```



### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **x_omnismith_project_id** | **UUID**| The project this call acts on. A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential&#39;s &#x60;projects&#x60; claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code &#x60;stale_project_grant&#x60;; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 &#x60;no_project_selected&#x60;. Two clients holding the same credential may send different values at the same time. | [optional] 

### Return type

[**ProjectSchemaResponse**](ProjectSchemaResponse.md)

### Authorization

[bearerAuth](../README.md#bearerAuth)

### HTTP request headers

 - **Content-Type**: Not defined
 - **Accept**: application/json

### HTTP response details

| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
**200** | Consolidated project schema definition |  -  |
**401** | Unauthorized |  -  |
**409** | No project is selected. The caller is authenticated but the request is tenant-scoped, so a project must be selected before it can be answered. The response body carries &#x60;\&quot;code\&quot;: \&quot;no_project_selected\&quot;&#x60;, which clients branch on to offer a project picker rather than an access-denied message. |  -  |
